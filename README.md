Programming Languages: Software developers need proficiency in one or more programming languages to write code and develop applications. Popular languages include:

Java: A versatile language used for building enterprise-level applications and Android development.
Python: Known for its simplicity and readability, Python is used in various domains, including web development, data analysis, and machine learning.
C++: Commonly used for system programming, game development, and performance-critical applications.
JavaScript: Primarily used for web development, enabling interactive and dynamic functionality in web pages.
Ruby: A dynamic, object-oriented language known for its simplicity and productivity.
Web Development: Skills related to building websites and web applications:

HTML: The fundamental markup language for creating the structure of web pages.
CSS: Used for styling and layout, defining the presentation of web content.
